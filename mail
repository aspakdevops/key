Hi Lavanya & Team,

I apologize for having to make this request, especially as I mentioned the situation on Monday. My project, Project Atlas, was scheduled to go live last weekend (Sunday), but unfortunately, due to some configuration issues, the launch was rolled back. Since then, my team and I have been working continuously to troubleshoot and identify the exact root cause. We now plan to go live next month.

Due to this situation, my DGM is not able to relieve me today as previously promised. I find myself in a difficult position and kindly request that you allow me to join in the first week of May. I am very excited about the offer and eager to join the team.

Once again, sincere apologies for any inconvenience caused. I look forward to contributing to the team soon.

Kind regards, [Your Name]
